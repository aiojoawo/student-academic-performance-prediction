# student-academic-performance-prediction
This project aims to assess the ability to predict students' performance in a final exam for a general subject based on their midterm grades and department. The goal is to provide instructors with a tool to identify students who may need additional support or effort before the final exam.
The grades were discretized into four categories and the categories are imbalanced. Four algorithms were tested on this data: XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. 

The data was retrieved from this article: https://tinyurl.com/train-data
