# student-academic-performance-prediction
This project aims to evaluate the ability to predict students' performance in a general subject final exam based on their mid term grades and department. This will give instructors the ability to identify students that need to put in more effort before the final exam. 
The grades are discretized into four categories and the categories are imbalanced. Four algorithms were tested on this data: XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. 

The data was retrieved from this article: https://tinyurl.com/train-data
